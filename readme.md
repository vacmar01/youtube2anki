# Youtube2Anki

This is a simple app that let's you create custom [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards from a youtube video. 

Right now I'm studying for my radiology board exam and and there is [this great youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPcImQzEnTpz-5TzxyyoYSbiAa9xdd89l) explaining the basics of MRI technology. I want to learn MRI with these videos and I'm a big fan of Anki and spaced repetition in general. 

*So I thought:* Let's use the "Magic of AI" to turn the transcript of Youtube videos into questions and answers that I can import into Anki as cards. 

In the background it uses [Mixtral](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/) through the [together.ai](https://together.ai) API to create the transcripts. 

You can find a demo of the app under [youtube2anki.fly.dev](https://youtube2anki.fly.dev).
