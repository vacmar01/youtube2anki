# Youtube2Anki

This is a simple flask app that let's you create custom [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) cards from a youtube video. 

Just paste in the youtube video id (the part after "watch?v=") and let the magic unfold. After that you can see the questions and answers and download them as a text file, which you then can import into Anki.
